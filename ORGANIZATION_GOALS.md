## TiDev Organization Goals

*Why does TiDev, Inc exist?*

TiDev, Inc exists for the following purposes:

 1. **To ensure the Titanium SDK is actively maintained and developed for years to come.** This means rapid attention to bugs introduced with new iOS/Android updates, as well as addition of features to the SDK that enable full compatibility with new features added to the iOS and Android mobile operating systems.
 2. **To actively grow the Titanium developer community.** This means organization of paid and volunteer efforts to make our documentation for the SDK amazing, make the technical process for a new programmer to work with the platform as simple as possible, and to encourage/boost/market programmers doing things such as live-streams demonstrating the capabilities of the platform.
 3. **To improve the reputation of the Titanium ecosystem.** This means showing corporations and programmers alike that this platform is amazing, actively supported, and can be trusted for building new applications.
 4. **To create a trusted channel for getting support around the platform.** This means marketing the free support provided via TiSlack and StackOverflow, as well as creating a paid enterprise support channel enabling large corporations to purchase dedicated support for the SDK from our core engineers. 
 5. **To better communicate what modules built for Titanium are actively supported and can be trusted for development.** This means keeping an active list somewhere, perhaps on the TiDev website, of what modules (and forks of modules) are actively maintained and useful. Aka, not abandonware.
