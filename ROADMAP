Roadmap Task List & Priority

TiDev Organizational Goals:
1.) That Titanium continues to work for every iOS/Android update.
2.) That it is as easy as possible for new developers to get into the ecosystem.
3.) That it’s EASY to find support for the platform (TiSlack, Paid enterprise support from TiDev.)
4.) That we certify which modules WORK, are SUPPORTED, and can be TRUSTED for development. (TiDev stamp of approval for things like Hans’ Firebase modules.)
5.) That we improve the reputation of the Titanium ecosystem with both developers and corporations that this platform is currently maintained, and trusted for future development projects. NO END OF LIFE.

——————————

Website Changes:
1.) Developer directory
2.) Corporate sponsor directory
3.) Add list of BLESSED and SUPPORTED modules for Titanium.
4.) Work on a really solid GETTING STARTED manual for making it as easy as possible to get new developers into the platform. React Native does this really well using playgrounds, etc, online.

Titanium Core Changes:
1.) Priority #1 — Always staying on top of iOS and Android SDK updates.
2.) Work on how new SDK releases will be distributed in a post-Axway managed world.
3.) Interoperability with npm modules is crticial
4.) Improved documentation around the Javascript core for Titanium.
- Someone from Appcelerator perhaps could chime in on this to assist in authoring this documentation.
5.) Add a “Titanium Doctor” module for resolving problems with why building, etc, isn’t working.

Modules:
1.) Identify modules that are crticial to the platform.
- Pay folks like Hans and Michael to keep those crtitical modules current on the platform.
2.) Add a bounty system for modernizing modules that TiDev isn’t directly supporting.
